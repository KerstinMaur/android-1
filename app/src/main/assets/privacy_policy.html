        <h3>WEBSITE REGISTRATION</h3>
        <p>
            The data subject has the option to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal information. The controller requests email data to be transmitted to the controller by the respective input mask (sign-up form) used for the registration. The personal information entered by the data subject is collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for its own purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            By registering on the website of the controller, the date and time of the registration are also stored. The storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Insofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller. This data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
        </p>
        <p>
            The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal information, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question. Registered persons are free to change the personal information specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal information are stored about the data subject. In addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal information at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations. A Data Protection Officer particularly designated in this data protection declaration, as well as the entirety of the controller’s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.

    <section id="website_contacts">
        <h3>WEBSITE CONTACTS</h3>

        <p>
            The Private Internet Access website includes information that enables data subjects to contact the controller via electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal information transmitted by the data subject is automatically stored. Such personal information transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal information whatsoever to any third parties.

        <h3>DISCLOSURE AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
            PrivateInternetAccess.com is a business that strives to protect privacy and the privacy rights of our clients. Although we will comply with all valid subpoena requests, our legal team scrutinizes each and every legal request that we receive for compliance with both the "spirit" and letter of the law. For invalid or overly broad subpoenas, we will often question or attempt to narrow the scope of any subject matter sought. Moreover, when it is possible and a valid option we will provide the user an opportunity to object to any requested disclosures. We cannot provide information that we do not have. PrivateInternetAccess.com will not participate with any request that is unconstitutional.

        <h3>DATA RETENTION</h3>
        <p>
            The data controller retains all account information and data indefinitely unless a data subject requests that their personal information be deleted. In the event of a deletion request, we will anonymize the personal information so it is not associated with a specific individual. From the moment we receive the request, this process takes up to 30 days to be reflected across all our systems.

The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal information and requests instead the restriction of their use instead. The controller no longer needs the personal information for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

        <b>Provision of personal information as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal information; possible consequences of failure to provide such data</b>
        <p>
            We clarify that the provision of personal information is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal information, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with some personal information when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal information would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal information is provided by the data subject, <u><b>in this circumstance</b></u> the data subject must contact our Data Protection Officer. Our Data Protection Officer clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal information is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal information and the consequences of non-provision of the personal information.

    <section id="legal_basis_for_data_processing">
        <b>Legal Basis for Data Processing</b>
        <p>
            Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the information subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal information is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal information may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal information. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).
